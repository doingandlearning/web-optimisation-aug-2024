## **Session 3: Network Performance Optimization**

### **Focus**: Understanding HTTP protocols and optimizing network performance.

---

### **1. Introduction to Network Performance**

#### **Overview**

- **Importance**: Network performance is critical to delivering a fast and seamless user experience. Optimizing the way resources are requested and delivered can significantly improve page load times.

- **Key Concepts**:

  - **Latency**: The time it takes for data to travel from the server to the client.
  - **Bandwidth**: The amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a given amount of time.
  - **Round Trip Time (RTT)**: The time it takes for a data packet to travel from the client to the server and back.

- **Interactive Discussion: Personal Experiences**
  - **Prompt**: "What network performance issues have you encountered, and how did you address them?"
  - **Activity**: Participants share their experiences, highlighting specific challenges and solutions.
  - **Outcome**: Compile a list of common network performance issues and effective strategies to address them.

### **2. Understanding HTTP Protocols**

#### **HTTP/1.1**

- **Features**:

  - **Text-Based Protocol**: The original HTTP protocol, designed for simplicity.
  - **Limitations**: Limited to one request per connection, leading to head-of-line blocking and increased latency.

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - **Persistent Connections**: Use Keep-Alive headers to reuse connections.
  - **Pipelining**: Allow multiple requests to be sent without waiting for each response.

#### **HTTP/2**

- **Features**:

  - **Binary Protocol**: More efficient than the text-based HTTP/1.1.
  - **Multiplexing**: Allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection.
  - **Header Compression**: Reduces overhead by compressing HTTP headers.

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - **Prioritization**: Assign priorities to different requests to improve load times.
  - **Server Push**: Proactively send resources to the client before they are requested.

#### **HTTP/3 and QUIC**

- **Features**:

  - **UDP-Based Protocol**: Built on top of the QUIC protocol, reducing latency and improving reliability.
  - **Improved Multiplexing**: Eliminates head-of-line blocking at the transport layer.
  - **Zero Round Trip Time (0-RTT) Resumption**: Allows faster connection establishment.

- **Potential Benefits**:
  - **Faster Connections**: Lower latency and quicker page loads.
  - **Better Resilience**: Improved performance over unstable networks.

#### **Interactive Q&A: Protocol Exploration**

- **Prompt**: "How have you implemented HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 in your projects?"
- **Activity**: Encourage participants to discuss their experiences with upgrading protocols and the benefits they've observed.
- **Outcome**: Share insights and best practices for transitioning to newer protocols.

### **3. Strategies for Network Optimization**

#### **Reducing Latency**

- **DNS Prefetching**: Resolve domain names before they are needed to reduce wait times.

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**:

  - **Purpose**: Distribute content across multiple servers to reduce latency.
  - **Benefits**: Faster load times by serving content from locations closer to the user.

- **Interactive Activity: CDN Configuration**
  - **Task**: Set up a basic CDN configuration for a sample website.
  - **Outcome**: Discuss the benefits and considerations of using CDNs, including caching strategies and regional distribution.

#### **Improving Bandwidth Utilization**

- **Image Optimization**:

  - **Compression**: Use formats like WebP or AVIF for better compression.
  - **Responsive Images**: Serve different image sizes based on device capabilities.

- **Minification and Compression**:

  - **CSS and JavaScript**: Minify code to reduce file sizes.
  - **Gzip/Brotli Compression**: Enable server-side compression for text-based resources.

- **Interactive Activity: Asset Optimization**
  - **Task**: Optimize images, CSS, and JavaScript for a sample website using compression and minification tools.
  - **Outcome**: Share techniques and tools for efficient asset optimization, and discuss the impact on performance.

#### **Leveraging Browser Caching**

- **Caching Strategies**:

  - **Cache-Control Headers**: Define how long resources should be cached.
  - **ETags**: Use entity tags to validate cached resources.

### **4. Lab Activity: Network Performance Analysis**

#### **Objective**

Analyze network performance and implement optimization strategies using real-world tools.

#### **Tools**

- **Chrome Developer Tools**
- **WebPageTest**
- **Pingdom**

#### **Steps**

1. **Select a Sample Website**: Choose a publicly accessible website for analysis, or use a provided sample site.

2. **Network Analysis**:

   - **Task**: Use the Network panel in Chrome DevTools to analyze resource loading times, latency, and bandwidth usage.
   - **Discussion**: Identify bottlenecks and propose solutions for reducing latency and improving bandwidth utilization.

3. **Protocol Evaluation**:

   - **Task**: Evaluate the current HTTP protocol used by the website and explore opportunities for upgrading to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
   - **Discussion**: Share insights on the benefits and challenges of transitioning to newer protocols.

4. **Optimization Implementation**:

   - **Task**: Implement network optimization techniques such as image compression, caching, and CDN configuration.
   - **Discussion**: Present the results and discuss the impact of the optimizations on performance metrics.

5. **Group Presentation**:
   - **Task**: Prepare a brief presentation summarizing the analysis and optimization strategies for the selected web page.
   - **Outcome**: Share insights, receive feedback, and refine approaches.
