### **Session 1: Introduction to Web Performance**

#### **Focus**: Understanding the importance of web performance and its impact on user experience and SEO.

### **1. The Growing Importance of Web Performance**

#### **Overview**

- **Definition**: Web performance refers to the speed and efficiency with which web pages are loaded and displayed on users' devices. It encompasses a variety of factors, including page load time, responsiveness, and visual stability.
- **Current Trends**: The average size of a web page has increased over time, leading to potential slowdowns in performance if not properly managed.
- **User Expectations**: Users expect fast and smooth online experiences, and a delay of even a few seconds can lead to significant drops in engagement and satisfaction.

#### **Key Points**

- **Performance and User Experience**:
  - **Statistics**: Research shows that 53% of mobile users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.
  - **User Engagement**: Faster websites tend to have higher engagement, lower bounce rates, and increased conversion rates.
- **Performance and Business Impact**:
  - **Revenue Loss**: Slow websites can lead to loss of revenue. Amazon reported that a 1-second delay could cost them $1.6 billion in sales annually.
  - **SEO Rankings**: Google considers page speed as a ranking factor, meaning slower sites may be penalized in search engine results.
- **Performance and Brand Perception**:
  - **Trust and Reliability**: Users often equate performance with reliability and trust. A slow website can negatively impact a brandâ€™s reputation.

### **2. The Cost of Slow Websites**

#### **Bandwidth and Infrastructure Costs**

- **Data Usage**: Larger page sizes increase data consumption, which can be costly for both the service provider and users, especially in regions with expensive data plans.
- **Infrastructure**: Slow sites may require additional server resources and infrastructure to handle the same amount of traffic, increasing operational costs.

#### **Competitive Disadvantage**

- **Losing Customers**: Slow websites risk losing customers to faster competitors, especially in highly competitive markets.
- **Differentiation**: In a landscape where users have numerous options, performance can be a key differentiator.

#### **Example Calculation of Impact**

- **Scenario**: Assume an e-commerce site with 100,000 daily visitors. A 2-second delay in page load time could lead to a 20% decrease in conversions.
  - **Daily Revenue Before Delay**: $100,000 (assuming $1 per visitor)
  - **Potential Revenue Loss**: $20,000 daily, $7.3 million annually.

### **3. Real-World Examples of Performance Improvements**

#### **Case Study 1: Pinterest**

- **Challenge**: Slow page loads were causing high bounce rates and low user engagement.
- **Solution**: Optimized page rendering and resource loading, including lazy loading images and minifying resources.
- **Results**:
  - 40% decrease in perceived wait times.
  - 15% increase in SEO traffic.
  - 15% increase in conversion rates.

#### **Case Study 2: BBC**

- **Challenge**: Large global audience with varying network speeds required faster loading times.
- **Solution**: Implemented a mobile-first strategy, optimized media content, and used caching effectively.
- **Results**:
  - 10% faster load times across their sites.
  - Improved user satisfaction and engagement.

#### **Case Study 3: Walmart**

- **Challenge**: Improving page load times to boost user experience and sales.
- **Solution**: Focused on reducing server response times, compressing files, and improving the overall architecture.
- **Results**:
  - For every 1-second improvement in load time, conversions increased by 2%.
  - Overall, a significant improvement in site performance led to a noticeable increase in sales.

### **4. Web Performance Metrics**

#### **Key Metrics to Track**

- **Page Load Time**: The total time it takes for a web page to load completely.
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: The time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of data from the server.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: The time it takes for the first piece of content to appear on the screen.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures how long it takes for the largest visible content to load, which impacts the perceived load speed.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Quantifies how much content moves around on the screen as it loads, affecting visual stability.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.

#### **Tools for Measuring Performance**

- **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Provides a performance score and actionable recommendations.
- **WebPageTest**: Offers detailed metrics and waterfall charts for in-depth analysis.
- **Lighthouse**: An open-source tool integrated into Chrome DevTools for auditing web performance.
