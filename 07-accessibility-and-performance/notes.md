## **Session 7: Accessibility and Performance**

### **Focus**: Balancing accessibility with performance optimization.

---

### **1. Introduction to Accessibility and Performance**

#### **Overview**

- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that web content is usable by all people, including those with disabilities. This includes users who rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.
- **Performance**: Optimizing the speed, responsiveness, and efficiency of a website or web application to enhance the user experience.

#### **Why Balancing Both is Crucial**:

- **Inclusivity**: A website that is fast but not accessible excludes a significant portion of the user base, particularly those with disabilities.
- **Legal Compliance**: Many regions have laws mandating web accessibility (e.g., ADA in the U.S., WCAG 2.1 globally). Non-compliance can lead to legal consequences.
- **SEO and Usability**: Accessibility improvements often benefit all users and can improve SEO, as search engines favor accessible content.
- **Performance Trade-Offs**: Some accessibility features, like large fonts or high-contrast themes, may impact performance, but with careful planning, these can be optimized.

#### **Interactive Discussion: Real-World Experiences**

- **Prompt**: "Have you faced any challenges in balancing accessibility and performance in your projects?"
- **Activity**: Participants share their experiences, discussing how they have addressed or plan to address these challenges.
- **Outcome**: Compile common challenges and potential strategies to balance these two important aspects of web development.

### **2. Meeting Accessibility Requirements**

#### **Web Accessibility Standards**

- **WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**:

  - **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive (e.g., text alternatives for non-text content).
  - **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable (e.g., keyboard accessibility).
  - **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable (e.g., readable text).
  - **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- **Common Accessibility Features**:
  - **Alt Text for Images**: Provides descriptions for users who cannot see images.
  - **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensures that all interactive elements can be accessed via keyboard.
  - **Semantic HTML**: Uses correct HTML tags to convey meaning and structure.
  - **ARIA Landmarks**: Enhances accessibility by providing additional context to screen readers.
  - **Contrast Ratios**: Ensures text is readable against its background.

#### **Interactive Activity: Evaluating Accessibility Standards**

- **Task**: Review a simple web page and identify potential accessibility issues based on WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
- **Outcome**: Discuss the issues found and how they can be addressed without negatively impacting performance.

### **3. User Expectations and Practical Solutions**

#### **Understanding User Needs**

- **Diverse User Base**: Recognize that users will have a range of needs, from visual and auditory impairments to motor disabilities.
- **Practical Examples**:
  - **Responsive Design**: Helps users with different devices, but also benefits those using screen readers.
  - **Text Scaling**: Allowing users to adjust text size without breaking the layout.
  - **Accessible Forms**: Clear labels, error messages, and instructions that are both accessible and performant.

#### **Balancing Accessibility and Performance**

- **Optimizing Images and Media**:
  - **Alt Text**: Ensure alt text is concise but descriptive, adding value without excessive load.
  - **Responsive Images**: Serve different image sizes based on device capability, reducing load time while maintaining accessibility.
- **Efficient Use of ARIA**:
  - Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes judiciously to enhance accessibility without adding unnecessary complexity or slowing down the page.
- **Lazy Loading**:
  - Apply lazy loading to images and iframes to improve performance without compromising accessibility (e.g., ensure that important content is still accessible immediately).

#### **Interactive Q&A: Implementing Solutions**

- **Prompt**: "What solutions have you implemented to balance accessibility with performance, and how effective were they?"
- **Activity**: Participants share their solutions and evaluate their effectiveness, discussing any trade-offs encountered.

### **4. Lab Activity: Accessibility and Performance Audit**

#### **Objective**

Conduct an accessibility audit on a web page and implement improvements while maintaining performance standards.

#### **Tools**

- **Axe DevTools**: A browser extension that automatically scans for accessibility issues.
- **Lighthouse**: A tool within Chrome DevTools that audits performance, accessibility, and SEO.

#### **Steps**

1. **Select a Web Page**:

   - Choose a web page that the participants are familiar with, or use a provided sample page.

2. **Run an Axe Accessibility Audit**:

   - **Task**: Use Axe DevTools to identify accessibility issues on the selected web page.
   - **Discussion**: Review the issues detected and prioritize them based on severity and impact on the user experience.

3. **Run a Lighthouse Audit**:

   - **Task**: Use Lighthouse to run a combined performance and accessibility audit.
   - **Discussion**: Compare the results, and identify areas where improving accessibility could impact performance and vice versa.

4. **Implement Accessibility Improvements**:

   - **Task**: Make necessary changes to improve accessibility based on the audit results, such as adding alt text, improving contrast, and enhancing keyboard navigation.
   - **Performance Check**: After implementing changes, re-run the Lighthouse audit to ensure performance standards are maintained.

5. **Group Presentation**:
   - **Task**: Prepare a brief presentation summarizing the audit findings, the improvements made, and how they balanced accessibility with performance.
   - **Outcome**: Share insights, receive feedback, and discuss any challenges encountered during the process.

### **5. Conclusion and Q&A**

- **Recap**: Review the key takeaways from the session, emphasizing the importance of balancing accessibility and performance.
- **Discussion**: Open the floor for any final questions or reflections on the session.
- **Next Steps**: Encourage participants to continue refining their skills in accessibility and performance, and to implement these practices in their ongoing projects.

---

### **Additional Interactive Ideas**

1. **Real-Time Accessibility Fixes**:

   - **Activity**: Participants can submit their own web pages for a live accessibility audit and quick fixes.
   - **Outcome**: Demonstrates how accessibility improvements can be made without significant impact on performance.

2. **Case Study Analysis**:

   - **Setup**: Present a case study of a well-known website that successfully balances accessibility with performance.
   - **Discussion**: Analyze the techniques used and how they could be applied to participants' projects.

3. **Accessibility and Performance Challenge**:
   - **Challenge**: Create a challenge where participants must optimize a web page for both accessibility and performance within a set timeframe.
   - **Reward**: Offer a small prize for the most effective balance achieved.
